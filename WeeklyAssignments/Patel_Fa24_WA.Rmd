# Initial Loading

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
# Week 1

To be able to figure out how to load a library in R, I went to google and searched up "load libraries in r". Then, I clicked on the top result as the description seemed to be what I was looking for. This was https://bookdown.org/nana/intror/install-and-load-packages.html. This gave me the instructions for both installing packages as well as loading libraries. I used the loading libraries instruction it suggested and ran it in a R code chunk. It ended up working correctly.

```{r}
? tidyverse
```
The 'tidyverse' is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and 'API' design. This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple 'tidyverse' packages in a single step. Learn more about the 'tidyverse' at https://www.tidyverse.org.
